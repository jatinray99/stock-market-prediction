The process initiates with the acquisition of historical stock market data from Yahoo Finance API, encompassing key parameters such as opening, closing, high, and low prices, along with trading volume, for selected stocks or indices. Following data collection, pertinent features are extracted, including daily stock prices, trading volumes, and various technical indicators like moving averages and relative strength index (RSI). Subsequently, rigorous data preprocessing steps are applied to ensure data quality, involving handling missing values, addressing potential outliers, and normalizing or scaling features for uniformity across the dataset. Moving forward, three distinct models are employed for predictive modeling: Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Random Forest Regression. The TCN model is adept at capturing temporal patterns and relationships within the data, while LSTM networks excel in modeling long-term dependencies and memory retention over sequential data. Additionally, Random Forest Regression, as an ensemble learning method, provides robustness against overfitting and is capable of handling a large number of input features. Evaluation of model performance entails comparing the predicted prices against actual prices over a predefined timeframe, typically spanning 100 days, and computing Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify prediction accuracy. Finally, based on the RMSE values obtained, the most accurate model is selected, taking into consideration factors such as computational efficiency, interpretability, and scalability for potential deployment or further analysis in predicting stock market prices.
